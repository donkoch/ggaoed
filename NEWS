ggaoed 1.0 (Mar XX, 2009)
=========================

New features:
-------------

- Batch I/O submission to reduce system call overhead
- Implement the "Mac Mask List" and "Reserve / Release" commands from
  revision 11 of the AoE protocol specification
- Make the AoE config information, the mac mask list and the reserve
  list persistent between daemon restarts

  need at least kernel 2.6.27 to use memory mapped packets.

ggaoed 0.9 (Jul 15, 2008)
=========================

First public release. Should be considered beta quality, meaning it is expected
to mostly work, but bugs (even serios ones) may still be present.
